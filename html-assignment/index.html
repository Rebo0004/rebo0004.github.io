            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Cristina. I'm studying the <em>Interactive Media Design Program</em>  at Algonquin College. I was born and race in Mexico, but I  moved to Ottawa on December 20<sup>th</sup>, 2021. One of my main goals is to become a <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>/<abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> designer to get a better and more enjoyable job in Canada.</p>              
            <p>A few years ago, I graduated as a <em>Graphic Designer</em>. Thus, I've had the opportunity to work in this field, especially in branding and social media. However, I realized that I stayed a lot of time in my comfort zone, just working with a monotonous routine. I've decided to change that and to enjoy not only my career but also my life.</p>
